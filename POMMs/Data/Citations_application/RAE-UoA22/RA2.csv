The authors have written an expository text, emphasising statistical methods and applications. Analyses of data-sets from a range of scientific contexts feature prominently, and simulations are used to illustrate theoretical results. The computational results in the book are supported by the authors' R-based software package, geoR, whose usage is illustrated in a computational section at the end of each chapter.

The research contents compiles and presents in a comprehensive way work done by the authors in the field with emphasis on a model-based approach to geostatistics, including Bayesian inference, expanding the linear geostatistical model to the framework of generalized linear models and geostatistical design. Also is shown how the geostatistical model can be use as a component in more general modelling strategies. The book's methodological novelty is particularly contained in Chapters 4, 6, 7 and 8.

Chapters 1 and 2 are introductory; providing a rationale for meta-analysis and the key concepts and terminology. Chapters 3 and 4 provide a general framework for meta-analysis based on study estimates of treatment difference and their variances, extending the approach previously published by the author in Statistics in Medicine. Chapters 5 and 9-12  contain mainly original research by the author covering the topics of  meta-analysis using individual patient data, dealing with non-standard sets of data,  inclusion of trials with different designs, a Bayesian approach to meta-analysis and sequential methods for meta-analysis. The author has published 5 papers based on the work described in these chapters in journals such as Statistics in Medicine. There is ongoing research based on the contents of Chapter 12.  Chapters 6-8 on dealing with heterogeneity, presentation and interpretation of results and selection bias mainly present methods which have appeared  in the literature by other authors.

The relation to existing research is explained at the end of each chapter.  Chapters 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 13 contain  largely original results, some of which we highlight below.

Chapter 3: Given a finite graph H, depending on r(n), the number of copies (in G) of H can be asymptotically Poisson or normal. Likewise for the number of components of G isomorphic to H. Multivariate extensions hold, with formulae for limiting means and covariances.

Chapter 6: Two-point concentration for the distribution of the maximum degree in the subconnective regime; likewise for clique number. Laws of large numbers for maximum degree and clique number in the subconnective and connectivity regimes.

Chapter 7:  The (random) threshold value of r at which the minimum degree on n random points achieves value k, satisfies a law of large numbers when k(n) is fixed or grows logarithmically.

Chapters 10 and 11: In the subcritical thermodynamic limit, the largest component of G grows logarithmically with n; in the supercritical case, it grows like n, also satisfying a CLT, and the second-largest component grows like log n to the power d/(d-1). The RUNT test for bimodality is consistent.

Chapter 13: Strong law for the threshold for k-connectivity. Thresholds for  k-connectivity and for minimum degree k are equal with high probability. Normal limit for the number of components in thermodynamic limit.

This chapter was peer-reviewed once by two referees, it was then discussed (along with other potential chapters for inclusion) at an Expert Group Meeting at the UN offices in New York.  All successful chapters then went through a second round of peer-review by two referees.  One further review took place by the Editor of the publication Graham Kalton.

Part of this book chapter provided an overview of the use of multivariate methods as exploratory and preliminary tools in the construction of indices using household-level variables.  The chapter then demonstrated various novel applications with data from Tanzania for the creation of indicators for measurement of poverty.  These applications provide useful research tools for developing country organisations, as well as international donors, to help them explore the extent to which their efforts at achieving the eight Millennium Development Goals have been successful in halving extreme poverty by 2015.

One is to give a description of the complete prior elicitation process and associated issues, such as how to structure an elicitation session, feedback, overfitting, judging the quality of an assessed distribution, and whose opinion should be represented from a group elicitation. This overview partly reflects the authors? opinions and their considerable experience in developing, testing and using elicitation methods. The other aim is to review results from the psychology literature that are relevant to the development of elicitation methods and to provide a much closer link between these results and the design of elicitation methods than has been given before. Elicitation methods that have been proposed are reviewed and compared, and results from psychology are used to evaluate their strengths and identify their likely biases. 

This is the first review of this area for many years, undertaken by three of the leading international authorities on the topic. It provides a thorough and up-to-date practical grounding in the important, yet sometimes mysterious, problem of eliciting prior distributions for research studies. As such, the article is likely to be influential in a wide range of areas: although published only in mid-2005, it has already been cited in journals in medicine, health economics, physical chemistry, climate change, planetary science and pharmacy, as well as statistics.

Originating in factor matching problems, more recent developments arise from a growing number of fields of application, including the analysis of sensory data (the research area of the second author) and shape analysis. Procrustes problems are concerned with matching two or more sets of data under restricted linear transformations; the book focuses especially on orthogonal, projection, direction cosine matrices, as well as constrained affine transformations. The latter provide the best way of generalising canonical correlation analysis to several sets of variables. Theory, algorithms and applications are covered.

The book imposes a logical structure to, and unification of, results dispersed throughout a large literature. In so doing, several new research problems are identified and new solutions provided to old problems. Two of the six appendices ?A minimisation problem? and ?Symmetric matrix products? might be regarded as research papers in their own right. Solutions are provided to some, but not all, the new problems. Others have subsequently provided research topics and publications for Gower and collaborators; yet other problems still require development. Thus, the book contains a substantial research component and provides a foundation for further research.

This strategy involved organising European Conferences sponsored by the OR Society in 1997, 2001 and 2005. Subsequent conference proceedings and special issues of international journals were published (4 to date in addition to a special issue of JORS due to appear soon). This paper is the third of a series of reviews, the second of which was published in 2000 and was awarded the Literati Club Award. 

This survey deals with the decision problems in operations including manufacturing and service industries. OR researchers have traditionally studied the four major decision categories in operations, as identified by the authors, namely: Design, Scheduling, Process Planning & Control and Quality, Maintenance & Fault Diagnosis. Over 1200 publications are reviewed on AI applications in these areas.

The authors utilized a novel method to evaluate current trends and identify gaps in research. The publication rates were analysed against what we might have expected given the known characteristics of the techniques. Our view on application areas of the techniques was developed by positioning the various OR and AI techniques on a decision field i.e. decision level versus problem structure. 
   
The Survey confirms various trends, some that one might expect, and others that are less expected. It is noted that like OR, AI studies currently exhibit less emphasis on the important category of executive ill structured problems. Moreover, development of hybrid intelligent systems is identified as an area that requires research effort. The paper has been published in a major OR journal (JORS) in recognition of its expected impact on the OR field.

Whilst the demand stimulation phenomenon is known anecdotally, there have been no reports of its existence in the form reported here:  a plausible generic behavioural simulation model which incorporates the contributing factors yet also (with appropriate parameterisation) reproduces the behaviour evidenced in data collected from two hospitals in the Home Counties which had expanded their diagnostic capacity in this way.

The paper considers how best to tackle the problem of capacity pressures by regulating the patient flow rather than by a mere knee-jerk reaction to enhance capacity.  Additionally, a methodological achievement is the formulation of a 'pressure summary index', a metric used in comparisons of different model runs, an important feature of the system dynamics modelling methodology.",,,False,,"K Taylor",True,,,,

Apart from the Final Report itself, presentation in this form allows a far fuller account than would be permitted with a journal article. It is the product of a major research project conducted over the period 2003-05 and is a novel application since the adoption of system dynamics modelling for macro-economic issues is in its infancy. However, the methodology has utility in this domain and the research serves as an example of a methodological counterpoint to the econometrics based projects commonly encountered.

The chapter stresses the importance of agreeing a purpose for the model with the clients. Here the purpose was one of managing a transition from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one. It meant that human resource development was a primary component of the analysis. (The human resource component has since spawned additional research both in Sarawak and the UK.) 

The model is described (with detail being given in an extensive appendix) and the behaviour arising from a number of specimen scenario runs, reflecting variants of possible policy options, is analysed. Additionally, some material is included which describes and reflects on an ?ease of use? shell (a microworld) which was developed in order to allow senior government officials (without the necessary software and modelling skills) to experiment with the model in their own time.

This involves use of a delay in a resource flow, but in a situation where there are two outputs but only one input - a bifurcation in the flow.  (Examples are: patients moving from one disease state to a later one, but some die and take a side flow out; goods arriving into a warehouse and eventually being sold, but some perish or are pilfered and take a side flow out.)

The exponential delays often used to model the output from a stock are so commonly needed in SD modelling that software vendors routinely offer special library functions which facilitate their use.  They equate to the Erlang family of probability distributions, where a first-order delay is equivalent to an Erlang type 1 distribution (negative exponential delay profile), second-order relates to an Erlang type 2 and so on.  An infinite order delay has zero variance on output and merely reproduces the input but x time periods later.

When running a model of the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS for a very long time (one of a set of standard validity tests employed in SD modelling) we discovered that the flow was gaining mass.  An enhanced checksum equation in the model showed that the patient flows in and out over the run (allowing for those there at the start and at the end) were not equal and that a physical stock was going negative.  The discrepancy could be traced to the (appropriate) use of a DELAY function to model an output on an occasion where the flow bifurcated.  The paper describes the mathematical adjustment to the DELAY function that is necessary to preserve the mass-balance. ",,,False,,"Y Fang",True,,,,

This paper presents a Bayesian approach to estimating a finite population total when the mean of the sample values is assumed to be proportional to a known covariate and the variance may take one of two possible values. Inferences about the mean and variance of the population total are made using the predictive distribution.

(eds.: A. Kyprianou, W. Schoutens and P. Wilmott) is a collection of cutting-edge research papers on the use of Levy processes as a mathematical tool in modelling exotic options. It consists of a compendium of refereed articles by a number of leading international researchers (including Geman, Madan, Eberlein, Peskir and Carr).

The contribution by Chan, ?Pricing perpetual American options driven by spectrally positive Levy processes?, was at the special request of the editors, because in their opinion, ?many important features of the perpetual American put pricing problem are observed?. To paraphrase one of the referees, it was among the first papers to observe the central role played by the so-called ?smooth-pasting? property in models of put options driven by Levy processes. This property has since been shown by others to play a central role in optimal stopping problems generally. In the context of put option pricing, the phenomenon of smooth-pasting was first observed by Samuelson in the 60s; more recently Gerber and Shiu, in a series of papers published in the late 90s have used this property to solve the problem of pricing a perpetual put on an asset whose price is driven by a jump-diffusion process. The paper by Chan extends the results of Gerber and Shiu by establishing smooth-pasting at the optimal exercise level for a perpetual put on an asset whose price is driven by a general spectrally-one-sided Levy process.",,,False,0,,,,,,

A 50-page manual is included with the package, giving an overview and a variety of examples.  Particular innovations in gnm include the development of tools for working routinely with over-parameterized representations of models --- specifically, generalized iterative algorithms and tools for the extraction, checking and presentation of inferences on validly interpretable parameter combinations.  The resulting package, published with full documentation through the open-source R project, allows researchers, especially those working in other disciplines, both to draw valid inferences (in many cases not available through other software) from their ""standard"" analyses, and to work easily with more general analyses suggested by the interactive approach to model-building and model criticism which gnm encourages.  

In 2007 the innovations and design of gnm led to its winning the John M Chambers Statistical Software Award of the American Statistical Association.

Initial public release of gnm to CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network)
was in June 2005.  The version of gnm submitted to RAE is 0.9-3, which was published on CRAN in September 2007 and contains minor improvements to the version (0.9-1) which was examined in detail by the Chambers Award judges.

The latest released version of gnm is always available at
http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/gnm.html
General information, including a PDF copy of the gnm manual, can be found at
http://go.warwick.ac.uk/gnm

The setting is thus how a statistician may act in a consulting role to a doctor faced with uncertainty and vaiability in data and attempting to combine past experience with observations on the current patient.  Motivated by real consultative problems presented in their initial form, appropriate statistical models are developed for the various parts of the clinical; process - describing experience, observation and measurement, assay, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, assessment.  While the aim of the book is expository it contains a number of research developments:  a resolution of the so-called paradox of complete separation in binary regression, various developments of compositional data anaylsis, measures of conditional atypicality of multivariate observations, the interplay of predictive and kernel density functions, and developments in the use of lattices of hypotheses for arriving at sensible working models.",,,False,,"Kay, J.

The study population is around 14000 children in Northern England. The collaboration is interdisciplinary: the co-author is an expert in comparative public health, and the results of the research are an important contribution to that area. The most revealing methodology employed is that of Poisson generalized linear modelling, together with some devised graphics. The most important new findings for public health policy are: the establishment of strong interactions between parental and sibling gender, smoking status, and child smoking status; age at start of smoking of child and the influence of such correlates; and the linking of the different smoking patterns and levels of addiction exhibited by girls and boys to environmental and social factors.",,,False,,"Cheung, P.",True,,,,

About one third of the material is new to this volume. All of the earlier work has been re-examined and adapted to provide a coherent and consistent development of the theory. The book covers the foundations, theory, methodology, mathematics and practicalities of the Bayes linear approach. It explains the main ideas, gives the important results and illustrates with practical examples. The book starts with a development of the basic language of Bayes linear analysis, describing the fundamental operations of belief adjustment and partial adjustment, the interpretation of such adjustments using belief transforms and the diagnostics for comparing beliefs with observation based on the bearing and the data trajectory.  We give a careful description of the role of exchangeability, which is fundamental to our approach in allowing us to create statistical models purely in terms of predictive statements over observables. We then discuss more general ways of analysing beliefs through generalised belief transforms, illustrated with statistical examples of various degrees of complexity. We develop methods for learning about variances and correlations from a Bayes linear perspective. We provide a general theory for comparison of alternative belief specifications for exchangeable multivariate samples, and graphical procedures to highlight the essential features of the analysis. We discuss the twin roles of Bayes linear graphical models, in representing both the qualitative structure and the quantitative effects of a Bayes linear analysis. We conclude by constructing all of the algebraic results that are needed for efficient implementation of the Bayes linear approach.",,,False,,"Goldstein, M.",False,,,,

The method is valid for quantitative and binary traits as well as for multiallelic markers. In the method, individuals are stochastically assigned into two etiological groups that can have both their own, and possibly different, subsets of trait-associated loci or alleles. The method is favorable especially in situations when etiological models are stratified by the factors that are unknown or went unmeasured, that is, if genetic heterogeneity is due to, for example, unknown genes by environment or gene by gene interactions. Additionally, a heterogeneity structure for the phenotype does not need to follow the structure of the general population; it can have a distinct selection history. The performance of the method is illustrated with a simulated example of genes by environment interaction and compared to the results of single-group analysis in the presence of missing data.

Recent versions of the software have added, for example: a built-in GIS with new algorithms for automated survey design (PhD work by Strindberg); methods that combine distance sampling and mark-recapture (papers by Borchers and others) implemented via a link to a new R library; methods for spatial density surface fitting (currently beta software; PhD work by Hedley, and other research). Feedback from users often inspires further research avenues, and on many occasions has led to funding for collaborative research projects, such as a recent US$1.5million award to develop methods for estimating population densities of sea mammals from undersea hydrophones.",,,False,7,"Laake, J L",True,"Marques, F F C",False,"Strindberg, S",False

It was published under the auspices of the ESCRS Endophthalmitis Study Group to acknowledge the contribution of the personnel across 24 European centres who contributed in different ways to the study.  The treatment found to be more effective was unexpected, and the statistical modelling revealed clear corneal incisions and silicone lens to be serious risk factors.

These distributions have been perhaps unjustly overshadowed by the multivariate normal distribution.  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of sampling distributions of certain statistics associated with multivariate t distributions.  The topics reviewed include: Wishart matrix, multivariate t statistic, Hotelling's T^2 statistic, entropy and Kullback-Leibler number.  The known simulation methods are also reviewed. We believe that this review could serve as an important reference and encourage further research activities espeically because multivariate t distributions offer a more viable alternative to multivariate normal distributions with respect to real-world data. We have already seen some unexpected applications in novel areas such 
as cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, multiple regression, robust projection indices, and missing data imputation.

In particular, it discusses in detail the Central Limit Theorem and convergence to the Poisson distribution, though there are also chapters concerning convergence on compact groups, convergence in free probability, and stable limit laws. It brings together my original research, both published and unpublished, as described below. The first chapter reviews previous work in these areas, laying the groundwork for the rest of the book by describing the relationship between entropy and Fisher? information, and Chapter 2 is an alternative treatment of the results in the paper by Johnson and Barron (2004) also submitted for the RAE.The rest of the book contains original research which does not overlap with the rest of my RAE submission. Chapter 3, 5 and 8 contain unpublished research material, concerning non-identical random variables, some progress towards convergence to stable laws and convergence in free probability respectively. Chapters 4 and 6 are closely based on two of my previously published research papers, Johnson (2000) and (2001). ?Chapter 7 gives an alternative treatment of original research published in the paper by Kontoyiannis, Harremoes and Johnson (2005).

The rate of adaptation is affected by the total mutation
rate, proportion of beneficial mutations, and population size $N$. We show that regardless of mutation rates, as long as the proportion of beneficial mutations is strictly positive, the adaptation rate is at least O(log^{1-\delta} N), if the population size is sufficiently large. This shows that if the genome is modelled as continuous, there is no limit to natural selection.
